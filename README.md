# Portugal-Flores-WebProject
Activity # 2: Personal Interest Website

We built a Movie Searching List Website for our Activity 2. This is for our Web Development Course under Mr. Madz Peragrino.
Mr. Portugal and Mr. Flores, both ardent movie enthusiasts, so we, collaborated on a website dedicated to fellow film lovers. We're motivated by a desire to enhance our CSS and JavaScript skills, as we embarked on this project as a challenge to ourselves. Utilizing an API, we built an interactive platform, that uses a search bar to find the user's desired movie.
